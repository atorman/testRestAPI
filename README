restTest Readme

Here's a little Rest API app that I use to test some of our API First stories.

This code is based on Metadaddy's TestRestAPIPage contribution: https://gist.github.com/metadaddy-sfdc/5860374. 

To use this code:
1. login into your salesforce.com org
2. Store bootstrap.zip as a static resource (only if you want to take advantage of bootstrap's CSS / JS)
3. add restTestPage as a visualforce page
4. add a custom tab pointing to the restTestPage
